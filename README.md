## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb Detailed Listings data for Tokyo from 2019 to better understand:

Question1 ... which area is more expensive at the center of Tokyo for staying via Airbnb?  
Question2 ... If an owner has good rating, is this house more expensive?  
Question3 ... If the house uses 'Futon', is the staying fee more expensive?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).  
Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
